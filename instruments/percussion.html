        There are a huge variety of percussion instruments, which play rhythmic beats and other sound effects in an ensemble. Percussion instruments are found in most musical genres and ensembles, from concert bands to rock bands. These instruments are usually played by hitting with the hand, beating with a stick, or shaking. There are many types of sticks that come in different sizes and materials. Different sticks are used for hitting particular instruments and produce different sounds. Some examples include drum sticks, yarn mallets, plastic mallets, and timpani mallets.
        <br><br>
        Bongos and congas have stretched skin that is hit with the hand. Snare drums, wood blocks, and triangles are some instruments that are hit with various sticks. Some instruments that are shaken include shakers and maracas. Some pitched percussion instruments, which can play tuned notes, include the glockenspiel, chimes, and timpani.
